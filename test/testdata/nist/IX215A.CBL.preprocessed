      *>     THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO TEST THE ABILITY TO
      *>     DESCRIBE THE PRIME RECORD KEY AND THE ALTERNATE RECORD KEYS
      *>     IN A REDEFINES CLAUSES AND TO TEST THE USE OF QUALIFICATION
      *>     OF THE RECORD KEYS.  THE PROGRAM IS BROKEN INTO THREE SEC-
      *>     TIONS.  THE FIRST SECTION TESTS THE ABILITY TO USE A
      *>     REDEFINED DATA ITEM OR A DATA ITEM SUBORDINATE TO IT CON-
      *>     TAINING THE LEFTMOST CHARACTER POSTIONS OF THE REDEFINED DATA
      *>     ITEM IN THE KEY PHRASE OF THE START STATEMENT.  THE SECOND
      *>     SECTION TESTS THE ABILITY TO USE A RECORD KEY WHICH IS NESTED
      *>     IN REDEFINES OR A DATA ITEM SUBORDINATE TO IT THAT CONTAINS
      *>     THE LEFTMOST CHARACTER POSITIONS OF A REDEFINED DATA ITEM
      *>     WHICH IS NESTED IN REDEFINES IN THE KEY PHRASE OF THE START
      *>     STATEMENT.  THE THIRD SECTION TESTS THE USE OF QUALIFICATION
      *>     OF THE RECORD KEYS.  DIFFERENT KEY VALUES ARE USED FOR
      *>     TESTING.  IF A KEY VALUE IS PROVIDED WHICH MATCHES A RECORD
      *>     IN THE FILE THE EXECUTION OF A START STATEMENT FOLLOWED BY A
      *>     READ NEXT STATEMENT IS EXPECTED TO MADE AVAILABLE THE RECORD.
      *>     IF A KEY VALUE IS PROVIDED WHICH DOES NOT MATCH ANY RECORD IN
      *>     THE FILE THEN THE INVALID KEY PATH IS EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN.
