      *>     KEY CLAUSE OR A DATA ITEM THAT IS SUBORDINATE TO THE
      *>     KEY NAME.   DIFFERENT KEY VALUES ARE USED FOR TESTING.
      *>     IF A KEY VALUE IS PROVIDED WHICH MATCHES A RECORD IN THE FILE
      *>     WHEN THE START IS EXECUTED THEN THE RECORD IS EXPECTED TO
      *>     MADE AVAILABLE BY THE SUBSEQUENT READ STATEMENT.  IF A KEY

      *>     THE FILE STATUS CONTENTS RESULTING FROM EXECUTION OF THE
